 I'll make it short. Thank you for taking the time to read this story. 
I'm always happy about attracting new readers, but I'm just as happy to 
welcome back those of you who have read some of my fanfic and perhaps 
even accompanied me on a very long <strong>Journey</strong> (I wonder if you'll be disappointed or pleased that my newest project after such a long hiatus isn't really new at all).</p><p>This fanfic is a rewrite of my 2010 fic <strong>The Teacher</strong>,
 and an attempt to perfect my favourite project yet. If you were to 
compare them, or if you've already read The Teacher, you'll find that <strong>Fortune's Might</strong>
 differs greatly from the original, not only regarding the new title and
 my improved style (I hope). Personally, I am very happy with the 
result, I hope you'll agree and maybe even let me know what you think. 
There'll be weekly updates every Saturday unless otherwise indicated. 
And now please enjoy <strong>Fortune's Might</strong>.</p><hr noshade="noshade" size="1"><p style="text-align:center;"><em>Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;</em><br><em>Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,</em><br><em>Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,</em><br><em>And do not drop in for an after-loss:</em><br><em>Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,</em><br><em>Come in the rearward of a conquered woe;</em><br><em>Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,</em><br><em>To linger out a purposed overthrow.</em><br><em>If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,</em><br><em>When other petty griefs have done their spite,</em><br><em>But in the onset come: so shall I taste</em><br><em>At first the very worst of fortune's might;</em><br><em>And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,</em><br><em>Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.</em></p><p style="text-align:center;">William Shakespeare, Sonnet 90</p><p><strong>Lesson One: Fait Accompli</strong></p><p>Icy
 rain was falling. The coldness that spread over the grounds and up to 
Hogwarts Castle from the village of Hogsmeade was not of the natural 
kind that followed in dusk's wake when the warmth of the sun slowly 
departed, held only by stone, water, or grass. It was the breathing of 
the Dementors stationed outside the perimeter walls that spread this 
coldness, that sucked from the air not only the warmth of the summer's 
day, but also all the positive feelings that usually accompanied the 
many people streaming into the school on the first of September. 
Everybody in the castle and the village had different feelings about the
 Dementors, though it was certain that nobody was entirely pleased that 
they were there, some surely believed to be safer with them gliding 
about, searching for an escaped convict who was rumoured to be on his 
way to Hogwarts.</p><p>To Professor Severus Snape they meant horrible 
memories resurfacing, bringing with them guilt, shame, and grief that 
had been buried in the darkest corners of his mind under the rather less
 unpleasant memories and thoughts of the past twelve years. It was 
dreadful how he suddenly remembered the faces of people whose lives he 
had seen being snuffed out, how he could recall the looks on their faces
 and the sickening feeling that had filled him when he had cast the 
Killing Curse for the first time.</p><p>Severus Snape was a private man,
 he would not talk about those experiences to anyone, which, as the 
Headmaster had pointed out to him, probably made them so hard to bear. 
Albus Dumbledore did not need Severus to put into words what he felt 
when the Dementors drew near, he knew the horrors of Severus's past like
 no other and understood better than anyone why he wished them gone. 
Albus, too, harboured a deep loathing for the creatures, had seen things
 in his past that he did not want to return to him so clearly as they 
did with the Dementors outside the perimeter walls of Hogwarts Castle.</p><p>But
 other than Severus, Albus could conceal the effect they had on him 
rather well. Severus, so Minerva McGonagall had said just this morning 
upon seeing him for the first time after the summer holidays, had turned
 even more unpleasant and vicious with the Dementors around, but she 
didn't blame him, for, she admitted, she herself was in rather a 
miserable mood. They would have to get used to it, wouldn't they?</p><p>The
 silence in the dungeons seemed even more absolute than usual, the only 
sound to be heard were Severus's footsteps echoing off the stone walls 
as he walked swiftly up the stairs after having finished the final 
preparations for the new school year. He was colder than usual too, 
inside and out. The Entrance Hall seemed emptier, more desolate, and the
 corridors more deserted than usual. The year ahead of him felt even 
less promising than it usually did when Severus knew he would not teach 
Defence Against the Dark Arts, and he thought the annoyed frustration 
about the unknown new staff member and Albus's secrecy seemed even more 
pronounced and powerful than the anger and indignation at Lockhart's 
appointment a year ago. He knew those were illusions, but he could not 
push them away. The moment Severus entered the staff room, he saw that 
the other teachers felt the same way. Everybody wore miserable 
expressions, there was no laughter in the room, no cheery conversations 
after weeks and weeks of not having seen each other.</p><p>Severus sat 
down in his favourite armchair by the fire, a little apart from the 
others as usual, and stared into the flames, his ears filled with the 
hushed voices of his colleagues as his mind drifted into the distance, 
fastening on more negative thoughts about the coming school year. 
Usually Severus looked forward to the start of term, for he could escape
 the desolate surroundings of Spinner's End and return to his much more 
comfortable rooms in the dungeons. This year though, Harry Potter and 
his fellow Gryffindors weren't the only factors that darkened this 
prospect. All summer, the papers had been full of a man whom Severus had
 hoped never to lay eyes on again. When Sirius Black had been arrested 
those twelve years ago, Severus had felt a grim satisfaction that his 
childhood tormentor had got what he deserved. But fate had never been 
kind to Severus. Somehow, as the first wizard ever to achieve it, Black 
had escaped from Azkaban, and was now on his way to Hogwarts to kill 
Harry Potter, or so rumour had it.</p><p>But as angry as Black's face in
 the papers had made Severus throughout the summer, he also felt a 
vindictive anticipation when he thought about Black's target, Harry 
Potter, because Severus had once sworn to protect that boy and this time
 it would be his pleasure to stop Black and punish him, face to face, 
and prove to him who had the upper hand now. But what chance did he have
 to capture Black when there were Dementors all over the place? Surely 
Black would not even get close to the castle. The Dark Lord's right hand
 – ha! – all good and well, but Severus, who had been close to the Dark 
Lord, who had been in the inner circle, did not know magic that would 
help Black break through Dumbledore's protection.</p><p>Severus sighed 
as McGonagall sat down beside him, giving him a stern look. Working with
 his former teachers was sometimes tiresome, for they treated him like a
 student, like a child at times, even though he was Head of House 
himself. McGonagall would always give him those looks that she usually 
gave misbehaving students. But he thought she respected him. It was 
mutual. Severus's respect was earned, not given, and she had earned it 
well. But he hated it when she gave him that look that clearly meant to 
say that he was going to be told something unpleasant.</p><p>"Did the 
Headmaster tell you whom he has appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts 
teacher?" she asked and he shook his head slowly, quite tired of this 
topic. It was the twelfth year running now. Albus had refused him the 
post for the twelfth year running.</p><p>"He said he had found somebody 
else when I asked him whether he would finally consider me for the 
position," said Severus quietly, "and he assured me that the new 
candidate would be far better suited than Lockhart."</p><p>"To which you
 replied that that only meant that he was not a completely incapable 
fraud," said McGonagall with the shadow of a smile. Severus glanced at 
her and grew slightly suspicious.</p><p>"You've talked about me?" he 
asked. McGonagall did not reply. "I hoped that Dumbledore had finally 
run out of dunderheads to appoint, but apparently he has found yet 
another sorry soul who's volunteering to meet a tragic fate at the end 
of the school year. Another incompetent fool, no doubt."</p><p>McGonagall's
 lips thinned. "The Headmaster really didn't tell you who it is, then?" 
she asked and was unusually careful. Severus narrowed his eyes at her 
and shook his head again. "Well, you will find that he – oh, excuse me 
for a moment," she added and strode to the window. Severus turned his 
head towards it and saw an owl sitting outside, carrying a roll of 
parchment. McGonagall opened the window, letting in the rushing sound of
 the falling rain, and took the note. She unrolled it and walked 
unconsciously back to where Severus was sitting, shutting the window 
with a swish of her wand. A small smile flitted over her face before it 
was squashed by anger. "Ah, those horrible creatures," she muttered as 
she sat back down. "Thank God he was with the children."</p><p>"What?" said Severus impatiently and she looked up, giving him another stern look.</p><p>"The
 Dementors searched the school train and Potter fainted," she said 
shortly and Severus raised an eyebrow at her. "It was to be expected, I 
suppose. Fortunately, our new teacher is on the train, and he sent me 
this note." Again that mysterious smile conquered her lips for a moment.
 "His handwriting still is horrible." A reminiscent note lay in her 
voice as she slipped the piece of parchment into her pocket.</p><p>"So he isn't a secret, is he?" asked Severus, now more interested than ever in the new Professor. "Albus only didn't want <em>me</em>
 to know who it is? Do tell me his name, then, Minerva, it must be 
somebody I know, else Dumbledore would not have bothered to keep it from
 me."</p><p>When Severus had arrived at Hogwarts Castle a few hours ago,
 he had thought that it would be another one of those years, during 
which he had to watch another idiot fighting his way through the Defence
 job, teaching the students nothing at all and annoying Severus 
immensely, while everyone knew that they would only stay for one year. 
The Headmaster had long run out of competent volunteers for the 
position. Lockhart had been the last straw. But apparently Albus 
believed that there was another person whom Severus would loathe so 
powerfully that telling him their name before term started meant risking
 open rebellion and far more trouble than it was worth.</p><p>But 
McGonagall did not yield the information. He saw her lips thinning as 
she got to her feet again. "The children are about to arrive, please 
excuse me, Severus, I need to inform Poppy so she can look after Potter 
when he arrives and I need to give Granger her Time-Turner," she said 
and started to walk away.</p><p>"Wait a moment," said Severus suspiciously, "what did that new teacher do when Potter fainted?"</p><p>McGonagall
 turned back to him and this time the smile stayed on her face. "He 
chased the Dementor away and handed out chocolate," she said simply and 
left the staff room. Severus scowled after her and tried to catch 
somebody else's eye but it seemed they had all been conditioned by Albus
 not to tell him anything. Maybe Albus thought he was being clever, but 
no matter whom he had found to fill the position, Severus would do his 
best to make sure that they had a very hard time at Hogwarts.</p><p>When
 some time later the buzzing voices of the arriving students reached the
 staffroom, everybody got ready for the feast and Professor Flitwick 
went to fetch the Sorting Hat because McGonagall was still tending to 
Potter and Granger, it seemed. Severus was just making to get to his 
feet when the door opened again and his colleagues all looked round to 
greet Dumbledore. Severus did not look round. He wanted to show Albus 
that he was still angry that he hadn't got the Defence job. Even though 
really being angry was becoming increasingly difficult, too much time 
had passed. It was merely a stubborn indignation now. But when the other
 teachers all approached the door, it was not Albus's voice that spoke 
to them but another man's. A voice that Severus could not seem to 
recognise despite its faintly familiar sound. He got to his feet, turned
 slowly round, and to his horror he found the reason why Albus had not 
told him the name of the new Defence teacher.</p><p>Just inside the 
door, looking rather astonished at the warm welcome he received, stood 
werewolf Remus Lupin. Albus had his hand on Lupin's shoulder, smiling 
behind his beard. Severus blinked to make sure that his eyes weren't 
playing a trick on him, but this was definitely Lupin, though Severus 
had not seen him in over twelve years, he knew his face well. True, he 
had changed rather strikingly, looking extremely shabby in his darned, 
threadbare robes, even more so because all the other teachers were 
wearing their very best. Lupin had grown older, his hair was greying, 
and he had a tired air about him, as though he hadn't slept in days, 
dark rings under his eyes – Severus registered briefly that last night 
had been the night of the full moon. Lupin was unhealthily thin, that 
much was evident even with the roomy robes that hung loosely round his 
frame. It was probably his condition taking its toll. But Severus could 
not care about such details now, when he finally had proof that Albus 
had gone mad.</p><p>Lockhart had merely been a desperate choice, there 
had been no one else who would have wanted to subject themselves to what
 was obviously a curse that ejected every DADA professor after a year of
 teaching, with more or less grave consequences. But employing a 
werewolf as DADA teacher, a werewolf, on top of everything, who had 
almost eaten Severus alive once, was not only questionable, it was 
outrageous and surely on the brink of being illegal! If the parents or 
the board of governors found out, Dumbledore would lose his job, no 
doubt. And Severus just couldn't believe that the other teachers had 
agreed to this, some of them having been teachers in Severus's time, 
like Flitwick and McGonagall, and therefore knowing full well what that 
man in front of them was. Had nobody objected to his employment? Had 
nobody been concerned about the children? Had nobody believed that this 
person might help Black into the castle, his old friend, possibly his 
accomplice? Had nobody remembered that this man had once been part of 
the gang that had made Severus's school days hell?</p><p>But judging by 
the way they all greeted Lupin interestedly, they were either unaware of
 his condition or they did not care. Severus strongly suspected that 
Albus had not told everybody about Lupin's lycanthropy, for he could not
 believe that so many of his colleagues were free of prejudice or fear. 
True enough, Lupin did not look remotely frightening. In fact he looked 
positively amiable the way he smiled mildly at everybody who shook his 
hand. Severus could have strangled him with his bare hands right then 
and there.</p><p>He did not care that it was obvious that life had not 
been kind to Lupin. No life could be unkind enough to atone for what he 
had done to Severus, no punishment would have been hard enough to erase 
Severus's bitterness. How dare he walk in here with that nonchalant 
smile and that self-confident air and snatch away Severus's job? Had he 
no decency? Had he no shame? Momentarily, Severus's anger about Black, 
Potter, and the Dementors was wiped away by a wave of loathing as 
Lupin's tired eyes turned on him and his smile twitched as he cocked his
 head to the side and his greying hair fell into his forehead. For an 
instant, Severus thought that something about this was unusual and he 
realised that Lupin had never looked at him directly at school, never 
met his eyes, always averted his own. But now he seemed bold, unafraid 
of Severus's wrath. Perhaps Albus had told him that Severus wouldn't 
make a scene in front of the other teachers, but that had been a big 
mistake.</p><p>That was typical of Albus. He hadn't even asked Severus 
for his consent, knowing that he wouldn't receive it. But he couldn't do
 this to Severus. Severus deserved respect, he deserved to be informed 
of such decisions as this, he ought to be consulted like the other Heads
 of Houses when a werewolf was appointed to teach his students and live 
under the same roof as them! What was Albus playing at, summoning this 
man out of nowhere? Surely he just wanted to annoy Severus thoroughly, 
he would think it amusing. Perhaps he had merely forgotten that Lupin 
had almost killed Severus, had played a lethal prank on him with his 
good-for-nothing friends and found it unnecessary to live up to his 
prefect's badge and stop them tormenting Severus. In Albus's memory 
there was only room for his precious Gryffindor favourites, who had 
assured him that they felt sorry for almost killing Severus on purpose.</p><p>Positively
 fuming with those thoughts, Severus strode towards Lupin and Albus, who
 were still standing at the door, chatting with the other teachers, and 
knocked a few of his colleagues out of the way as others retreated, 
noticing the murderous look on his face. As he drew nearer, he attracted
 Albus's attention and the Headmaster's eyes twinkled annoyingly as he 
spoke.</p><p>"Ah, Severus! May I present you with our new Defence Against the –"</p><p>"So
 this was your brilliant plan?" Severus cut across him angrily, jerking 
his head at Lupin. "Telling me nothing about him until it was already 
too late for me to object? While everybody else was informed you kept me
 in the dark! Do you consider this a proper way of treating one of your 
Heads of Houses?"</p><p>"Do you think your objection would have made a 
difference, Severus?" asked Albus pleasantly, surveying him over his 
half-moon spectacles, and Severus was very close to jinxing him. He must
 look dangerous, too, since the sparse rest of his colleagues backed off
 now, knowing how unpleasant he could be.</p><p>But all the while, Lupin
 showed no sign of intimidation or caution. Though he seemed mildly 
surprised, he did not move an inch but merely raised his eyebrows, 
glancing at Albus as his face gave away a trace of dawning comprehension
 and disapproval. "I take it you did not tell Severus about my 
appointment, Headmaster?" he said hoarsely. He sounded different, too, 
much older, and his calm resolution in the face of Severus's anger bore 
no resemblance to the boy he had once been. "I thought he had been 
informed. You said he had agreed to –"</p><p>"How daft must you be to think that I would <em>ever</em> agree to <em>your</em>
 appointment?" snapped Severus, whose anger was only multiplied by 
Lupin's calmness. Lupin raised his eyebrows higher and the corners of 
his mouth twitched, but he did not respond. Severus thought he detected 
amusement in the wrinkles round Lupin's eyes and found him an 
impertinent dunderhead.</p><p>"Severus," Albus said in a warning tone. 
"Neither of you would have agreed if you had known the truth. So I – ah –
 warped the facts a little."</p><p>Severus wanted to make a retort but 
then something popped into his mind. During the summer holidays, Albus 
had approached him about a new discovery made in the field of 
lycanthropy potions that Severus had tried to ignore stubbornly because 
it had been made by the show-off Damocles Belby and earned him an Order 
of Merlin: the Wolfsbane Potion, that rendered a werewolf harmless at 
the full moon when drunk during the week preceding it, having the effect
 of keeping the werewolf in his right mind even when in the wolf's body.
 Albus had asked whether Severus had heard of it, for it was quite 
sensational, and if he thought he could brew it, since it seemed quite a
 complex potion to make. Severus had, of course, shot him a venomous 
look and replied, "Brew it? I could improve it to ten times the quality 
it has now. Whatever Belby thought he was doing, presenting the world 
with this piece of imperfect brewery …"</p><p>In other words, "Whatever 
Belby can do, I can do better!" But really, how could he have foreseen 
that Albus was asking him that question for such a purpose as this? 
Moreover, Albus obviously expected him to dedicate his precious time to 
the well-being of a werewolf who had not only been part of Black and 
Potter's bullying gang but also knowingly tried to kill him as a 
teenager. He could not possibly believe that Severus would take it just 
like that.</p><p>"I am astounded that you did not even warn me, that you did not even ask me if I'd be willing to sacrifice my free time to –"</p><p>"Quite
 frankly, Severus," interrupted Albus, his voice rising slightly to 
drown Severus's, "I had no interest in being badgered by you all over 
the summer with complaints, threats and reproaches merely because I did a
 Headmaster's duty and appointed a new teacher for a vacant post. I much
 rather wanted the two of us to enjoy a quiet summer without ill 
feelings. For you must believe me that, though I do value your opinion, 
none of your objections to this particular choice of staffing would have
 changed anything about my resolution to appoint Remus." He paused, 
smiled at Lupin, who was looking between Albus and Severus with raised 
eyebrows and twitching lips, apparently unsure whether to smile or not 
in the face of Severus's indignation. "And I would consider your 
extraordinary skill wasted if you didn't use them benevolently at least 
once in your life, my boy," added Albus when Severus took a deep breath 
to argue again.</p><p>"You are making a severe mistake, Headmaster, in 
appointing this man," said Severus forcefully, pointing at Lupin and 
shooting him a look of deepest contempt that he deflected with a calm 
smile. "And if you think that you can force me to –"</p><p>"Severus," 
Albus cut in, now applying a tone that was dangerous in its coldness. 
Severus fell silent at once, but glared at Lupin relentlessly. "I chose 
the one man that I thought best for the job. It was my decision and if I
 remember correctly I am the Headmaster of this school and that is why 
you will accept my decision and do what you are told, I think I deserve 
that much respect. And now enough of your complaints!"</p><p>Severus was
 fuming. He hated being told off. But he did not dare say anything more 
on the topic. "You spoke to the other teachers, then?" he pressed and 
now Lupin did look a little apprehensive as he, too, looked round at 
Albus. Apparently he feared that Albus had "warped the facts" concerning
 this detail, too.</p><p>"I spoke to the other Heads of Houses," said 
Albus with a nod to Professor Sprout, who was watching the scene, and 
Professor Flitwick, who was just passing the staffroom with the Sorting 
Hat, "and with the assurance that I would take full responsibility, they
 agreed to let him have a try. I told them and Remus that you would brew
 the Wolfsbane Potion for him, to the best of your ability if I know 
you, to keep Remus safe at the full moon. That is the sole condition 
Remus set for coming here and since I have full trust and confidence in 
you, Severus, I also have full trust and confidence in Remus's ability 
to teach here, as one of us. As for most of the other teachers, as well 
as the students, I must ask you to remember the promise you once made to
 keep Remus's condition a secret. Needless to mention that I would find 
it rather extraordinarily tactless if any of us addressed the topic in 
any kind of public conversation anyway."</p><p>Severus looked from one 
to the other of them in stubborn silence for a few moments, taking in 
Albus's demanding gaze and Lupin's expectant look, then he jerked his 
head in defiant consent, seeing no way around it. Lupin looked relieved 
and smiled all the more warmly at Severus, who gave him his coldest, 
most scathing glare. But it had no effect whatsoever on the werewolf. 
Even Lupin's mere sight made Severus sick. The kindness in his eyes in 
the face of Severus's anger was plainly provocative. Severus was sure it
 was meant to be. He wondered how Albus imagined this to work.</p><p>"Excellent,
 Severus! Naturally I shall provide you with all the ingredients you 
need and of course you will be relieved of certain other duties to make 
time for the brewing of Remus's Potion. I do hope that you two will be 
able to work alongside each other in peace," added Albus sharply and 
Severus gave him an incredulous look that Albus did not miss. "I do rely
 on you, Severus, and I hope that you will not disappoint me."</p><p>Severus
 stared daggers at him for this aside. He knew that it was a warning of 
the Dumbledorish kind. "I shall do my best, Headmaster," Severus pressed
 between clenched teeth and with balled fists.</p><p>"I never doubted 
that, Severus," replied Albus nodding, but though Lupin's face gave away
 no doubt, his eyes flickered towards the Headmaster, and Severus knew 
that he had not been so sure about Severus doing his best until a moment
 ago. In an instant, though, Lupin had covered this up and looked at 
Severus with gratitude quite plain and disgusting on his face.</p><p>"Well,
 then I thank you very much, Severus," he said hoarsely and with a 
familiarity that Severus found highly inappropriate when it was so clear
 that contempt was radiating from him. But Lupin did have the sense not 
to extend his hand to shake Severus's. So he must be able to read the 
situation but was stubborn enough to keep up the friendly politeness.</p><p>"I
 am not doing this for you," said Severus coldly, looking him straight 
in the eye, finding an amber colour that he had never noticed there nor 
seen in anybody else's eyes before. "I am merely doing my duty," he 
added in a snarl and now glared daggers at Lupin instead of Albus. But 
Lupin seemed entirely unaffected and merely raised his eyebrows again 
with that amused light playing around his eyes.</p><p>"I thank you 
nonetheless," he said mildly, and for a moment Severus wondered if this 
really was the boy he had known, for he seemed so different.</p><p>Lupin
 was relaxed and self-assured, he did not avert his eyes when Severus 
looked into them, he did not back down. But at the same time he was not 
offensive or aggressive, the provocation lay in his unwaveringly calm 
smile itself, not in his behaviour, which was friendly and quite at 
ease. He did not attack, he merely stood his ground come what may, or so
 it seemed to Severus, he was steadfast and would bend to nobody. Like a
 rock in the middle of a stream would not budge when water rushed 
towards it, no matter how wild or strong. It commanded a strange kind of
 respect in Severus that he could not fight. People who would not back 
down when he confronted them always had that effect on him. But it was 
not the same defiance that McGonagall sported. It was quiet and gentle, 
surreptitious and taciturn. One less attentive than Severus would miss 
it. But to him it was clearly visible in that determined smile, never 
changing, that was curling the werewolf's lips so mysteriously into a 
silent mask that was much less obvious than Severus's, much less 
obtrusive. And despite himself, Severus wished he could prise it off and
 see what lay beyond it.</p><p>"Ah, Remus, Minerva told me about the 
Dementor on the train and that you fought it," said Albus pleasantly 
into the stretching silence and Severus noticed that he was staring at 
Lupin, who was gazing back quite steadily. Severus averted his eyes 
before he could stop himself, scowling around the room in the attempt of
 making it look as though he had merely been unable to bear Lupin's 
sight any longer. But something told him that Lupin knew he had just 
gained a first small victory.</p><p>"Yes, but unfortunately Harry had 
already fainted, and he was quite shaken when his friends woke him," 
said Lupin, sounding grim for the first time. "Of course I had some 
chocolate on me, just in case. But the damage had been done, the 
children were quite shocked, and I believe you know as well as I what 
Harry must have felt when that wretched creature entered the 
compartment. It is irresponsible to let them loose on the students, 
Sirius Black on the run or not."</p><p>"I quite agree," said Albus 
gravely and Severus looked round at them, two Gryffindors in greatest 
worry about the bloody Potter brat. "But I could not refuse. At least I 
managed to prevent them coming into the grounds. I am glad you were with
 the children, Remus, who knows what would have happened if you hadn't 
been there to help. I trust Minerva has already thanked you?"</p><p>"Oh,
 yes," replied Lupin and looked both abashed and pleased, "I met her 
right inside the castle, just briefly. I was very pleased to see her 
again."</p><p>"And she to see you, trust me," said Albus, his eyes twinkling. "She was very concerned about the safety of her students –"</p><p>"Student," interjected Severus and they both looked at him, Lupin amused, Albus scolding.</p><p>"Well,
 now that we have resolved this," said Albus with a significant look 
between Severus and Lupin, "I believe we could all do with a good 
dinner. Let us go to the Great Hall," he added loudly to the other 
teachers and he led the way through the doors, followed by the staff.</p><p>But
 Lupin did not move, he nodded at the teachers passing him, all of whom 
seemed rather fond of him already, but stayed put himself, standing 
opposite Severus with his smile back in place. Severus stayed where he 
was, narrowing his eyes at Lupin, and expected him to have something 
more to say to him. Curiosity had got the better of him now, and when he
 searched the werewolf's amber eyes, he found that his mind was rather 
tightly closed, impossible to penetrate for Severus without the werewolf
 noticing. It awoke his interest. What lay hidden behind that smile, 
those eyes? When the last of their colleagues had left the staffroom, 
something odd happened to Lupin's smile. It changed quite suddenly, 
became so different that it startled Severus for a moment. In an instant
 it had changed so entirely without any real physical change to it that 
Severus wondered if he imagined it.</p><p>"I hope we will get along well," said Lupin, inclining his head in an amicable way that made Severus snort.</p><p>"Hope can be treacherous," he retorted silkily, folding his arms tightly over his chest.</p><p>Lupin's
 smile widened and he shrugged. "And it never dies," said he and his 
voice was soft. Then he chuckled and again Severus had the impression 
that he was quite at ease and enjoying himself. At Severus's expense no 
doubt. His chuckle was quite husky and Severus wondered what it was that
 made the man so hoarse. Underneath the premature lines and grey hair 
Lupin looked young and handsome. But he appeared very tired indeed, 
worn, like a miner at the end of the day, a miner who had not eaten in 
days.</p><p>But Severus was far from pitying him. He felt positively 
livid. Lupin could not possibly be labouring under the delusion that 
Severus could just forget what had happened between them. The fact that 
Lupin would almost have had to remove what remained of Severus from 
between his teeth was too serious to just push it aside and act as 
though nothing had happened. It was unimaginable that Lupin actually 
believed that they could "get along well". Severus would pay him back 
with contempt for every single second that he had to spare for brewing 
that highly complex Potion, which prevented the werewolf destroying his 
rooms. Besides, Severus didn't like the fact that there was now yet 
another person at Hogwarts who remembered him as a helpless, worthless 
boy.</p><p>But most shocking of all was perhaps that, despite his hatred
 for the man, Severus could not help noticing the curve of his jaw, the 
unwavering smile and the twitching in the corners of his mouth, but most
 of all the magnificent amber colour of his eyes, twinkling much like 
Albus's, shining golden in the candlelight, as more than merely 
agreeable. He appreciated this kind of handsomeness, enhanced by the 
lines the past years had carved into Lupin's skin and the silver streaks
 it had painted into his light brown hair. It was the kind that would 
have caught his eye had he passed the werewolf in the street, unaware of
 his identity. Notwithstanding the shabbiness of his robes, the tired 
expression, the unhealthily thin frame, the dark rings under his eyes. 
Lupin was the kind of man who looked nonchalantly, effortlessly handsome
 even when ill. Whose smile captured Severus's eyes and would not let 
them go again.</p><p>Severus wanted to make it disappear, he couldn't 
bear it. "Life hasn't been kind to you, has it, Lupin?" he said smoothly
 as Lupin made to turn away. Lupin stopped but made no reply. He seemed 
to be waiting for more to come. "I would have thought that you'd at 
least buy yourself a new set of robes for tonight."</p><p>Lupin turned 
slowly round, his smile still twitching mysteriously. He met Severus's 
glare quite steadily with his astonishingly amber eyes. Yes, amber, 
indeed, not usual brown. But that was neither here nor there. Still 
there was something in them, some strange light that almost made Severus
 back off. "It means nothing to me," said Lupin, cocking his head to the
 side again. "It surprises me that it does to you." He said it quite 
calmly but Severus couldn't help feeling uneasy.</p><p>As Lupin turned, 
his smile widening still, Severus thought he looked as though he wore 
those patched robes like ermine and purple round his shoulders and that 
impression did not cease when he glanced at him at the High Table, 
sitting rather far away from him. Even though he looked even shabbier in
 the Great Hall, with its gold plates and everybody in their best robes,
 he had an air about him like a weary king, surrounded by his noisy 
entourage. One could have thought he was wearing the most magnificent 
robes of all, for all it seemed to matter to him. Remus Lupin seemed to 
be looking past such sordid matters as appearance, had learnt, perhaps, 
that it made no difference how expensive or handsome one's clothes were 
if they concealed a rotten character. And maybe it was what people 
called "inner beauty" that enhanced his outer appearance. Severus shook 
his head at the thought. Ridiculous.</p><p>Lupin looked as though he was
 quite happy where he was, sitting beside Flitwick, chatting with him 
rather animatedly. Severus found that he was insolent for showing so 
openly that he relished the position that should have been Severus's 
when it was Severus who enabled him to work at Hogwarts. Shooting 
loathing glances down the table at Lupin, Severus wondered how he could 
manage to get rid of him without actually laying hands on him. Albus 
would know if he did. But having to associate with Lupin for a whole 
year, not least of all because of the Wolfsbane, was promising to make 
this year an especially unpleasant one. Not even the prospect of 
catching Black could lighten Severus's mood. Dementors, werewolves, and 
murderers everywhere. It couldn't be a coincidence that Lupin turned up 
now of all times, when Black was on his way to Hogwarts. Albus must see 
this connection, he could not be so blind, this werewolf could not be 
trusted, Albus had seen what he was capable of even at a young age.</p><p>After
 the feast, Severus returned to his rooms, frustrated and tired. He shed
 his robes on his way to bed and fell into the sheets with a heavy sigh.
 What if Lupin helped Black to kill Potter? How would Albus feel then 
about his decision to appoint Lupin instead of Severus? Not that Severus
 didn't approve of any plan that involved Potter's untimely death. He 
sighed again. No, this wasn't about Black or Potter, this was about the 
fact that Albus had appointed a man who had helped making Severus's 
adolescence the most unpleasant and humiliating time of his life. He 
felt betrayed. He would have to talk to Albus. First thing in the 
morning.</p><p>He pulled the blanket over his head and closed his eyes. 
And thought of Lupin's face. He couldn't help it. This was something 
irrational that couldn't be suffocated by his dislike. It was 
inexplicable. There was something in those eyes and that smile, in that 
mild face that made Severus feel … no, impossible, he shouldn't even 
think about that. But it was there, no doubt, a feeling he couldn't 
suppress, fueled by that involuntary respect Lupin commanded. It was 
inappropriate and unwanted. But something about Lupin had Severus see 
him even when his eyes were closed. And his mere sight made his anger 
cease, replaced by a burning curiosity and a wish to figure him out. He 
had felt it before, at school. And yet he hated the man, he loathed him 
for it. And now he had to bear his terribly relaxed behaviour and his 
annoyingly mysterious smiles. There was nothing he could do about it. 
But as he lay there, drifting off to sleep, his last irrational thought 
was that he might not want Lupin to go away at all, at least not before 
he had unraveled the mystery behind those defiant smiles.</p>
